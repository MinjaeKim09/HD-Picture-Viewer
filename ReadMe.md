# High-Definition Picture Viewer
*For the TI-84 Plus CE*

By TheLastMillennial


## To Use
- Send "HDPic.8xp" and any example image(s) you'd like to see to your calculator.
- Using ICE, compile the program and execute it. 
- The program currently only displays a thumbnail image, pauses, then quits.

### Custom images
- Open and compile "HD Picture Converter CE.sln". 
- Make sure that windows_convpng.exe is in the same directory
- Once the application window appears, click on 'open file' and select an image. The image may need to be reduced in quality. When finished converting, a preview image of the 2 halves will be shown. You can now click 'open folder' and copy the converted .8xv files to your calculator.
